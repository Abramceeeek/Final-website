      <h2 class="section-title">Who I Am</h2>
      <div class="section-content">
        <p>Hello! I'm Abdurakhmonbek Fayzullaev, a postgraduate student in Actuarial Science and Data Analytics with a deep passion for quantitative finance, mathematical modeling, and intelligent risk-taking. My background bridges theory and application—where abstract mathematical concepts evolve into models that drive decision-making in uncertain financial environments.</p>
        
        <p>I specialize in understanding and simulating risk through tools such as stochastic processes, Monte Carlo methods, and volatility modeling. My interests lie in option pricing, financial engineering, capital structure analysis, and building frameworks for dynamic hedging and trading strategies.</p>
        
        <p>Whether I'm analyzing market dynamics, building portfolio risk models, or developing Python-based trading systems, I strive to extract clarity from complexity. I believe that mathematics isn't just a language of precision—it's a tool for navigating the unpredictable, especially in the fast-paced world of finance.</p>
        
        <p>When I'm not immersed in data or models, I enjoy exploring the intersection between behavioral finance, algorithmic trading, and the psychological side of risk—constantly learning, experimenting, and refining both mindset and methods.</p>

        <h2 class="section-title">My Philosophy</h2>
        <div class="section-content">
          <p><strong>Mathematics as a Lens:</strong> I believe mathematics is more than equations—it's a disciplined way to understand risk, value, and uncertainty. Whether in markets or models, I rely on mathematical thinking to bring clarity to complex systems.</p>
          
          <p><strong>Markets Are Systems, Not Chaos:</strong> I see financial markets as dynamic ecosystems shaped by data, sentiment, and probability. My approach is to analyze them systematically—using tools like stochastic modeling, options theory, and quantitative frameworks to uncover structure within volatility.</p>
          
          <p><strong>Modeling Before Assumption:</strong> In both finance and life, I value rigorous modeling over intuition. I prioritize evidence, simulations, and data-driven forecasts before drawing conclusions or taking positions.</p>
          
          <p><strong>Trading as a Craft:</strong> I view trading as an applied science—an exercise in decision-making under uncertainty. It combines discipline, probabilistic thinking, and emotional control, where the goal isn't prediction, but preparation and adaptation.</p>

          <p><strong>Lifelong Curiosity:</strong> Markets evolve. So must I. I stay committed to continuous learning—whether through reading academic papers, testing trading strategies, or deepening my understanding of financial theory and behavioral dynamics.</p>

      <section class="content-section">
        <h2 class="section-title">What Drives Me</h2>
        <div class="section-content">
          <p><strong>Curiosity for Complexity:</strong> I'm attracted to systems that defy simple answers—financial markets, human behavior, or distributed apps. I subsist on untangling these enigmas with rigorous thinking and inventive experimentation.</p>
          
          <p><strong>Mathematical Insight:</strong> I see beauty in equations and order in uncertainty. Whether financial modeling, data analysis, or algorithmic thinking, math shapes my approach to and philosophy for problem-solving in life.</p>
          
          <p><strong>Tech for Transformation:</strong> I don't view technology as a mere tool, but rather as a means to intelligent transformation. I strive to develop tools that enhance human capacity and decision.</p>
          
          <p><strong>Risk as Opportunity:</strong> I think the best advances are achieved where risk and responsibility intersect. My background in risk management and actuarial science causes me to embrace uncertainty—instead of shying away from it.</p>

          <p><strong>Discipline Through Growth:</strong> Mastery is forged in discomfort. I'm driven by a culture of ongoing learning—whether it's pushing myself in code, streamlining models, or mastering new financial concepts.</p>

          <h3 class="card-title">Early Curiosity</h3>
          <div class="card-content">
            <p>My interest in numbers began early—with a fascination for how mathematical principles explain the world. This curiosity naturally led me toward finance, where numbers aren't just abstract—they tell stories of risk, behavior, and decision-making under uncertainty.</p>

          <h3 class="card-title">Academic Foundation</h3>
          <div class="card-content">
            <p>Pursuing a master's in Actuarial Science and Data Analytics, I developed a rigorous understanding of financial mathematics, probability theory, and statistical modeling. My academic journey equipped me to tackle real-world problems—ranging from valuing complex financial instruments to simulating risk under extreme scenarios.</p>

            <p>Over time, I transitioned from theory to application. I began working on models for dynamic hedging, capital structure analysis, and options trading. Whether through Monte Carlo simulations, stochastic volatility models, or Python-based risk engines, I focus on using quantitative tools to turn uncertainty into strategy.</p>
