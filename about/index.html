      <h2 class="section-title">Who I Am</h2>
      <div class="section-content">
        <p>I'm Abdurakhmonbek Fayzullaev — a results-driven professional with a strong analytical mindset, currently working as a Specialist at Apple Inc. in London and holding an MSc in Actuarial Science & Data Analytics from Queen Mary University of London (Russell Group). I combine quantitative expertise with real-world performance: last quarter at Apple, I delivered 100 business introductions with 57% conversion, sold 400+ units, and was awarded the Apple Applause Award.</p>
        
        <p>My academic foundation — a First Class Honours degree in Economics with Finance from Westminster International University in Tashkent, followed by postgraduate study in actuarial risk management, machine learning, and financial modelling — gives me the tools to simplify complex problems into clear, actionable steps. My dissertation focused on dynamic hedging of equity-linked variable annuities using Monte Carlo simulation and Solvency II frameworks.</p>
        
        <p>Across every role I've held — from processing 1,500+ visa applications at 99% accuracy, to growing student satisfaction from 75% to 90% at an education consultancy, to increasing sales by 14% through data-driven budget allocation — I've consistently identified gaps, built systems, and delivered measurable improvements. I led a team to the Top 20% of 1,000+ global teams in the Bloomberg Global Trading Challenge, and I hold certifications from Harvard and Google Cloud.</p>
        
        <p>I'm goal-oriented with a big-picture mindset, interpersonally savvy, and inclusion-focused. I create environments where colleagues and customers feel respected and confident — including providing the first Russian-language customer support at my Apple store. I'm eligible for the Graduate Route visa (no sponsorship required for 2 years) and am proficient in English, Russian (C1), and Uzbek.</p>

        <h2 class="section-title">My Philosophy</h2>
        <div class="section-content">
          <p><strong>Mathematics as a Lens:</strong> I believe mathematics is more than equations—it's a disciplined way to understand risk, value, and uncertainty. Whether in markets or models, I rely on mathematical thinking to bring clarity to complex systems.</p>
          
          <p><strong>Markets Are Systems, Not Chaos:</strong> I see financial markets as dynamic ecosystems shaped by data, sentiment, and probability. My approach is to analyze them systematically—using tools like stochastic modeling, options theory, and quantitative frameworks to uncover structure within volatility.</p>
          
          <p><strong>Modeling Before Assumption:</strong> In both finance and life, I value rigorous modeling over intuition. I prioritize evidence, simulations, and data-driven forecasts before drawing conclusions or taking positions.</p>
          
          <p><strong>Trading as a Craft:</strong> I view trading as an applied science—an exercise in decision-making under uncertainty. It combines discipline, probabilistic thinking, and emotional control, where the goal isn't prediction, but preparation and adaptation.</p>

          <p><strong>Lifelong Curiosity:</strong> Markets evolve. So must I. I stay committed to continuous learning—whether through reading academic papers, testing trading strategies, or deepening my understanding of financial theory and behavioral dynamics.</p>
        </div>
      </section>

      <section class="content-section">
        <h2 class="section-title">What Drives Me</h2>
        <div class="section-content">
          <p><strong>Curiosity for Complexity:</strong> I'm attracted to systems that defy simple answers—financial markets, human behavior, or distributed apps. I subsist on untangling these enigmas with rigorous thinking and inventive experimentation.</p>
          
          <p><strong>Mathematical Insight:</strong> I see beauty in equations and order in uncertainty. Whether financial modeling, data analysis, or algorithmic thinking, math shapes my approach to and philosophy for problem-solving in life.</p>
          
          <p><strong>Tech for Transformation:</strong> I don't view technology as a mere tool, but rather as a means to intelligent transformation. I strive to develop tools that enhance human capacity and decision.</p>
          
          <p><strong>Risk as Opportunity:</strong> I think the best advances are achieved where risk and responsibility intersect. My background in risk management and actuarial science causes me to embrace uncertainty—instead of shying away from it.</p>

          <p><strong>Discipline Through Growth:</strong> Mastery is forged in discomfort. I'm driven by a culture of ongoing learning—whether it's pushing myself in code, streamlining models, or mastering new financial concepts.</p>
