      <h2 class="section-title">Who I Am</h2>
      <div class="section-content">
        <p>Hello! I'm Abdurakhmonbek Fayzullaev, a driven MSc student in Actuarial Science & Data Analytics at Queen Mary University of London with a strong foundation in finance, mathematics, and programming. I'm passionate about problem-solving and thrive in data analysis, risk modeling, and financial decision-making.</p>
        
        <p>My academic journey includes a First Class Honours degree in Economics with Finance from Westminster International University in Tashkent, where I studied Corporate Finance, Investment Risk Management, and Probability & Statistics. Currently, I'm deepening my expertise with modules in Risk Management, Financial Data Analyses, and Time Series Analysis.</p>
        
        <p>I have demonstrated leadership capabilities as Team Captain in the Bloomberg Global Trading Challenge, where I led 4 analysts in developing a trading strategy that achieved a 12% return over 4 weeks, ranking in the top 20% of 1,000+ global teams.</p>
        
        <p>My professional experience spans technology, financial services, data management, and client relations across multiple industries. I'm currently working as a Specialist at Apple Inc., providing technical support and achieving 95% customer satisfaction. I'm proficient in Python (pandas, NumPy), R, SQL, Bloomberg Terminal, and Excel financial modeling, with additional certifications from Harvard's Python programming courses.</p>

        <h2 class="section-title">My Philosophy</h2>
        <div class="section-content">
          <p><strong>Mathematics as a Lens:</strong> I believe mathematics is more than equations—it's a disciplined way to understand risk, value, and uncertainty. Whether in markets or models, I rely on mathematical thinking to bring clarity to complex systems.</p>
          
          <p><strong>Markets Are Systems, Not Chaos:</strong> I see financial markets as dynamic ecosystems shaped by data, sentiment, and probability. My approach is to analyze them systematically—using tools like stochastic modeling, options theory, and quantitative frameworks to uncover structure within volatility.</p>
          
          <p><strong>Modeling Before Assumption:</strong> In both finance and life, I value rigorous modeling over intuition. I prioritize evidence, simulations, and data-driven forecasts before drawing conclusions or taking positions.</p>
          
          <p><strong>Trading as a Craft:</strong> I view trading as an applied science—an exercise in decision-making under uncertainty. It combines discipline, probabilistic thinking, and emotional control, where the goal isn't prediction, but preparation and adaptation.</p>

          <p><strong>Lifelong Curiosity:</strong> Markets evolve. So must I. I stay committed to continuous learning—whether through reading academic papers, testing trading strategies, or deepening my understanding of financial theory and behavioral dynamics.</p>

      <section class="content-section">
        <h2 class="section-title">What Drives Me</h2>
        <div class="section-content">
          <p><strong>Curiosity for Complexity:</strong> I'm attracted to systems that defy simple answers—financial markets, human behavior, or distributed apps. I subsist on untangling these enigmas with rigorous thinking and inventive experimentation.</p>
          
          <p><strong>Mathematical Insight:</strong> I see beauty in equations and order in uncertainty. Whether financial modeling, data analysis, or algorithmic thinking, math shapes my approach to and philosophy for problem-solving in life.</p>
          
          <p><strong>Tech for Transformation:</strong> I don't view technology as a mere tool, but rather as a means to intelligent transformation. I strive to develop tools that enhance human capacity and decision.</p>
          
          <p><strong>Risk as Opportunity:</strong> I think the best advances are achieved where risk and responsibility intersect. My background in risk management and actuarial science causes me to embrace uncertainty—instead of shying away from it.</p>

          <p><strong>Discipline Through Growth:</strong> Mastery is forged in discomfort. I'm driven by a culture of ongoing learning—whether it's pushing myself in code, streamlining models, or mastering new financial concepts.</p>
